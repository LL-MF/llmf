This Virtual machine is using ubuntu \(32 bit\)

Other packages used: -

PHP  
Apache  
MySQL

This virtual machine is having medium difficulty level with tricks.

One need to break into VM using web application and from there escalate privileges to gain root access

For any query ping me at [https://twitter.com/IndiShell1046](https://twitter.com/IndiShell1046)

首先需要找到靶机IP，使用Nmap

`nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24`

结果如下

Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.7
Host is up (0.00017s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
